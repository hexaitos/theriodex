<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p class="block">A simple Pokémon guessing game where you will be presented with a blurred sprite of a Pokémon and will have to guess its name! The higher the difficulty, the higher the blur and the fewer hints you get – hard difficulty will not give you any hints at all! You will be able to decrease the blur by a certain degree as well as skip Pokémon you really cannot guess at all. You will also get a score counter that keeps track of how many correct guesses you have made and how many Pokémon you skipped! Try it out!</p>
