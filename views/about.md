# About Theriodex

Theriodex is a small little project that I – [Hexaitos](https://hexaitos.eu) – am working on in my free time mostly as a programming exercise. It is an open-source Pokédex written in Ruby using [Sinatra](https://sinatrarb.com) and a handful of other Ruby gems.

I am not quite sure how much this Pokédex will end up covering once it is finished, but for now, you are able to look at a random Pokémon by going to the homepage and you will be shown its sprites along with some useful (and some not so useful) information You are also able to see the shiny variants by clicking the “Show shiny” button beneath the two sprites as well as see female variants and animated sprites when they are available. A [fuzzy search](/search) functionality has also been added to search for specific Pokémon.

I highly recommend checking out this project’s official [git repository](https://git.btlr.sh/hexaitos/theriodex), as you will be able to find the project’s README there which contains a bunch of planned features as well as instructions on how to run this yourself, if you so wish.

## Acknowledgements

I want to thank the folk behind [PokeAPI](https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokeapi) and [Veekun’s Pokédex](https://github.com/veekun/pokedex) who are responsible for the data in this repository’s database. Thanks also to [GGBotNet](https://www.ggbot.net/) for creating the fantastic pixel fonts I am using.

A special thanks also to all my partners – who are way better at programming and database queries than I am – for helping me out a lot and answering my questions and giving helpful tips. I definitely would not have been able to get as far with this project if it hadn’t been for them. Thanks 🩵
